# Welcome to the Dioptra GitHub Organization

[Dioptra](https://dioptra.io/) is an Internet cartography research group based at Sorbonne University.

Our main initiative is the [Sorbonne IP Route Survey (IPRS)](https://iprs.dioptra.io/). The software that we produce to advance it is free, open-source, and liberally-licensed.

This organization hosts our primary development work. We welcome you to explore our public repositories and reach out if you're interested in contributing.
